# Vibe Reading

Vibe Reading is a browser extension for reading and translating web pages with
local configuration and user-provided AI or translation providers.

This fork is intentionally narrow: **reading only**. It keeps the full-page
reading and translation workflow, removes the product-suite features around it,
and does not depend on a project-hosted backend. Features that need a network
service, such as AI translation, use the provider endpoints and API keys
configured by the user.

## Features

- 📖 Reading-first full-page translation.
- Full-page translation with bilingual and translation-only display modes.
- Paragraph and page-title translation for content-heavy pages.
- LLM-based language detection for auto-translate and skip-language rules.
- Context-aware AI translation using page content and summaries.
- Configurable AI and translation providers, including local or self-hosted
  provider endpoints.
- Custom prompts, translation styles, page rules, and batch/rate controls.
- Local import/export for configuration portability.
- No Notebase, hosted account, hosted storage, telemetry dashboard, or project
  backend dependency.

## Proudly Missing

Vibe Reading is smaller on purpose. Compared with the upstream Read Frog project,
Immersive Translate-style translation suites, browser built-in translators, and
general AI sidebar tools, this fork proudly avoids features that distract from
reading.

## Removed Upstream Features

| Removed capability                                     | Why it is absent                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🗄️ Notebase hosted storage and backend-backed features | Vibe Reading does not rely on a project-hosted backend.                          |
| 🧠 Custom AI Actions                                   | This fork is not a general AI action launcher.                                   |
| 🎬 Video Subtitles                                     | Video translation is outside the reading-only scope.                             |
| ⌨️ Input Translation                                   | Vibe Reading avoids modifying text input workflows.                              |
| 🧰 Overlay Tools                                       | Less overlay UI means fewer distractions on reading pages.                       |
| 🔊 Text to Speech                                      | Audio playback is outside the reading-only scope.                                |
| 🔗 translation-hub                                     | No bundled upstream hub integration.                                             |
| ☁️ Config Backup                                       | Hosted backup is removed; local import/export remains.                           |
| 🧪 Beta Experience                                     | Experimental feature gates are removed.                                          |
| 🚦 Extension Activation Mode                           | Page translation is controlled by direct translation actions and page rules.     |
| 📈 Statistics                                          | No local analytics dashboard or charting dependency.                             |
| 🌍 Language Detection mode setting                     | Language detection always follows the LLM path; there is no basic/LLM mode knob. |

The result is deliberately simple: **Vibe Reading is for reading.**

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
SKIP_FREE_API=true pnpm test
pnpm type-check
pnpm build
```

`src/utils/host/translate/api/__tests__/free-api.test.ts` depends on live
external translation services. Set `SKIP_FREE_API=true` for local validation.
