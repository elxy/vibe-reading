# Vibe Reading

Vibe Reading is a browser extension for reading and translating web pages with
local configuration and user-provided AI or translation providers.

This fork is intentionally narrow: **reading only**. It keeps the full-page
reading and translation workflow, removes the product-suite features around it,
and does not depend on a project-hosted backend. Features that need a network
service, such as AI translation, use the provider endpoints and API keys
configured by the user.

## Features

- 📖 Reading-first full-page translation.
- Full-page translation with bilingual and translation-only display modes.
- Paragraph and page-title translation for content-heavy pages.
- LLM-based language detection for auto-translate and skip-language rules.
- Context-aware AI translation using page content and summaries.
- Configurable AI and translation providers, including local or self-hosted
  provider endpoints.
- Custom prompts, translation styles, page rules, and batch/rate controls.
- No Notebase, hosted account, config backup, telemetry dashboard, or project
  backend dependency.

## Proudly Missing

Vibe Reading is smaller on purpose. Compared with the upstream Read Frog project,
Immersive Translate-style translation suites, browser built-in translators, and
general AI sidebar tools, this fork proudly avoids features that distract from
reading.

| 🐸 Upstream Read Frog                            | Learning tools, hosted integrations, more modes | Notebase, hosted storage, Custom AI Actions, Beta Experience | Focused page reading and translation     |
| 🌊 Immersive Translate-style translation suites  | Broad translation surfaces across many media    | Video subtitles, input translation, overlay tools, TTS       | Web page reading translation             |

## Removed Upstream Features

| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🗄️ Notebase hosted storage and backend-backed features | Vibe Reading does not rely on a project-hosted backend.                                   |
| 🧠 Custom AI Actions                                   | This fork is not a general AI action launcher.                                            |
| 🎬 Video Subtitles                                     | Video translation is outside the reading-only scope.                                      |
| ⌨️ Input Translation                                   | Vibe Reading avoids modifying text input workflows.                                       |
| 🧰 Overlay Tools                                       | Less overlay UI means fewer distractions on reading pages.                                |
| 🔊 Text to Speech                                      | Audio playback is outside the reading-only scope.                                         |
| 🔗 translation-hub                                     | No bundled upstream hub integration.                                                      |
| ☁️ Config Backup                                       | Vibe Reading keeps settings local and has no config sync, backup, import, or export flow. |
| 🧪 Beta Experience                                     | Experimental feature gates are removed.                                                   |
| 🚦 Extension Activation Mode                           | Page translation is controlled by direct translation actions and page rules.              |
| 📈 Statistics                                          | No local statistics dashboard or charting dependency.                                     |
| 🌍 Language Detection mode setting                     | Language detection always follows the LLM path; there is no basic/LLM mode knob.          |

The result is deliberately simple: **Vibe Reading is for reading.**

## Development

## Fork Lineage

This project is a downstream fork. The lineage is:

[mengxi-ream/read-frog](https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog) →
[Xuanwo/vibe-reading](https://github.com/Xuanwo/vibe-reading) →

To avoid confusion with the upstream `Xuanwo/vibe-reading`, this fork is
published to extension stores as **"Vibe Reading (fork)"**.

## Changes from Upstream

### Relative to `Xuanwo/vibe-reading`

- **Restored configuration import/export.** Back up or restore all settings
  (excluding the translation cache) as a versioned JSON file from the
  `/config` page. Upstream removed config backup intentionally; this fork
  re-adds a minimal local-only variant for migration between devices.
- **Packaging and submission preparation.** Rebranding for store
  disambiguation, Firefox manifest fields required by current AMO policy,
  build and privacy documentation.

### Relative to `mengxi-ream/read-frog`
